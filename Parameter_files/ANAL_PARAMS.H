  GALAXY PARAMETERS
  NEW in v1.4:

  The ionizing efficiency zeta is allowed to scale with the halo mass:
  \zeta = N_{\gammaUV} x f_{esc} x f_{\ast}

  where:
  f_{\ast} = STELLAR_BARYON_FRAC x (M_{halo}/10^10 M_{sol})^STELLAR_BARYON_PL
  f_{esc} = ESC_FRAC x (M_{halo}/10^10 M_{sol})^ESC_PL

  The number of halos hosting active galaxies (i.e. the duty cycle) is assumed to
  exponentially decrease below M_TURNOVER Msun, : fduty \propto e^(- M_TURNOVER / M)

  See eq. (?) in Park et al....

  The fiducial 2 parameter galaxy model with a constant specific ionizing luminosity down
  to a threshold halo mass, M_TURNOVER, is recovered by setting *_PL parameters to zero.
  This results in the fastest runs.

  MINI HALO PARAMETERS
  NEW in v1.5:

  The ionizing efficiency zeta is allowed to scale with the halo mass
  in two channels -- atomic and molecular cooling halos:
  \zeta_ato = N_{\gammaUV} x f_{esc} x f_{\ast} 
  \zeta_mol = N_{\gammaUV,mol} x f_{esc,mol} x f_{\ast,mol}
  \zeta     = \zeta_ato + \zeta_mol

  where:
  f_{\ast}     = STELLAR_BARYON_FRAC x (M_{halo}/10^10 M_{sol})^STELLAR_BARYON_PL
  f_{esc}      = ESC_FRAC x (M_{halo}/10^10 M_{sol})^ESC_PL

  f_{\ast,mol} = STELLAR_BARYON_FRAC_MINI x (M_{halo}/10^10 M_{sol})^STELLAR_BARYON_PL
  f_{esc, mol} = ESC_FRAC_MINI

  and 
  Note that in the current version
  1. the scaling of f_{\ast,mol} is the same as f_\ast
  2. f_{esc, mol} is a constant
  3. t_STAR is the same as the atomic cooling halo
  4. the duty cycle of atomic halos is:
     f_\mathrm{duty,atom} = e^{-\max\left[M_\mathrm{turn},M_\mathrm{crit,atom}\left(z\right)\right]/M_\mathrm{h}}
     with 
       M_\mathrm{crit,atom} corresponds to the atomic cooling threshold (T~1e4K), which 
       essentially split halos into atomic and molecular cooling halos.
       M_\mathrm{crit,atom} = 1e8/h * ((1e4 / 1.98e4) / (0.59/0.6) /\
                              ((Omega_m / Omega_m_z(z)) * (Delta_c(z)/18/pi**2))**(1./3) /\
                              ((1.+z)/10))**(1.5)
               Omega_m_z(z) = 1./(1.+(Omega_L/Omega_m/(1.+z)**3))
               Delta_c(z)   = 18 * pi**2 + 82 * (Omega_m_z(z) - 1.0) -39 * (Omega_m_z(z) - 1.0) ** 2

  5. the duty cycle of molecular halos is:
     f_\mathrm{duty,mol}  = e^{-\max\left[M_\mathrm{turn},M_\mathrm{crit,LW}\left(z,r\right)\right]/M_\mathrm{h}}
                            \times \left[1 - e^{-M_\mathrm{crit,atom}\left(z\right)/M_\mathrm{h}}\right]
     with
       M_\mathrm{crit,LW}  corresponds to the suppression due to Lyman-Werner (LW)
        background, which according to Visbal, Haiman & Bryan 2017, is
      M_\mathrm{crit,LW}\left(z,r\right) = 2.5\times10^5 \mathrm{M}_\odot 
              \times \left\{1+6.96\left[4\pi J_\mathrm{LW,21}\left(z,r\right)\right]^{0.47}\right\}
              \times \left(\frac{1+z}{26}\right)^{-1.5}
      in this version, we do not consider the spatial fluactuation of J_LW,21 and take advantage of Wise+12 result
      \log_{10} J_\mathrm{LW,21}(z) = -2.356 + 0.4562z -0.02680z^2 + 5.882\times10^{-4}z^3 -5.056\times10^{-6}z^4
