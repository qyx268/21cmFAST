This folder contains some output, resulting from calling `Programs/drive_logZscroll_Ts`.

The 21-cm power spectra are in the `Power_spectra` directory, in ASCII format, with the columns corresponding to `<k>` `<power in k>` `<cosmic variance std in power>`.

Note the power spectra include redshift space distortion, i.e. `SUBCELL_RSD = 1` in `ANAL_PARAMS.H`.

Corresponding 2D slices through the brightness temperature offset fields are in the `Sliceplots` directory. These are subsequently generated by

```bash
cd Pics/
python sliceplot.py -i ../Boxes/delta_T_v3_z0*
```
